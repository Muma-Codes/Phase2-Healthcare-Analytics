   - Develop risk stratification models for high-risk groups

2. RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION
   - Review lab procedure protocols for efficiency
   - Optimize medication management to reduce polypharmacy
   - Implement length-of-stay reduction initiatives

3. PATIENT CARE IMPROVEMENTS
   - Focus on patients with multiple comorbidities
   - Enhance monitoring for circulatory complications
   - Develop age-specific care pathways

4. DATA QUALITY INITIATIVES
   - Improve data collection for variables with high missingness
   - Implement validation rules to prevent missing critical data
   - Standardize coding practices across departments

=======================================================
8. LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK
=======================================================

9. CONCLUSION
=======================================================

This Phase 2 analysis successfully demonstrates the application
of foundational data science techniques to healthcare data.
Through systematic data collection, quality assessment, cleaning
and exploratory analysis, we have:

✓ Addressed all research questions with data-driven insights
✓ Identified key patterns in readmission and resource use
✓ Generated actionable recommendations for healthcare management
✓ Created comprehensive visualizations for decision support
✓ Documented a reproducible analytical workflow

The insights generated provide evidence-based support for
healthcare administrators to make informed decisions about
resource allocation, patient care improvements and readmission
prevention strategies.
